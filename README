So far this contains two .py files that will be used to compute
Homology for a simplicial complex.  Boundary.py takes a complex K
and returns the boundary map as a matrix.  Reduction.py performs
the redcution algorithm outlined in Munkres' Elements of 
Algebraic Topology (and likely in any algebraic topology text).
The last thing needed will be to take the output of reduction
and give the homology groups. Additionally, I will likely try to
write code to compute persistent homology.  

I'll also add more instructions on how to use the code already
up.
